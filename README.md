# Roblox StepfordAutopilot Train Speed Detection and Modification

## Project Overview

This project is a personal learning endeavor aimed at exploring the basics of machine learning (ML) and computer vision (CV). The goal was to develop a Python script capable of detecting the speed of trains in a Roblox Stepford Trains game using real-time frame and image analysis, and then modify the speed accordingly within the game. This project allowed me to experiment with frame processing, image analysis, and real-time data manipulation, all within the context of a familiar and interactive environment.

## Learning Objectives

- **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** Understanding how ML techniques can be applied to real-time image data to detect specific objects and features.
- **Computer Vision Techniques:** Gaining hands-on experience with CV libraries like OpenCV for processing video frames and extracting meaningful information.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Learning to handle and process data in real time, an essential skill for interactive applications.
- **Integration with Roblox:** Experimenting with linking Python-based ML/CV scripts with a game environment, bridging the gap between data analysis and in-game modifications.

## How It Works

1. **Frame Capture:** The project captures frames from the Roblox game using screen recording or video stream methods.
2. **Speed Detection:** Using image processing techniques, the script analyzes the captured frames to detect the movement and speed of train models within the game.
3. **Speed Adjustment:** Once the speed is detected, the script modifies the speed of the trains within the game by interacting with the gameâ€™s scripting environment.
4. **Real-Time Feedback:** The entire process operates in real-time, continuously updating as new frames are processed.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python:** The core programming language used for scripting and integration.
- **OpenCV:** Used for frame capture, image processing, and feature detection.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations and data handling.
- **PyAutoGui** For changing current speed of train.

## Challenges and Learning Outcomes

- **Real-Time Processing:** Managing and processing video frames efficiently to ensure minimal lag and accurate speed detection.
- **Image Analysis:** Developing skills in object detection and tracking using basic CV techniques.

## Conclusion

This project served as a practical introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning and computer vision, specifically focusing on real-time image processing. It provided valuable insights into handling frames and images, as well as integrating Python scripts with external applications like Roblox, making it a rewarding learning experience.
